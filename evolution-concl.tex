\section{Conclusions}
\label{s:concl}

This paper assesses the evolution of performance penalties for
mitigations against transient execution side-channel attacks by
measuring their overheads across several generation of Intel and AMD
CPUs. Although the time passed since the first mitigations is short,
we observe a few trends: 1) on an OS-intensive workload the
overhead of mitigations has declined from over 30\% on our oldest
processor to under 3\% on the most recent CPUs; and 2) JavaScript
sandboxing stresses different mitigations, whose overheads are
significant and unchanged across successive generations.

A further analysis of individual mitigations shows that the hardware
improvements in successive generations have reduced the overhead of
some mitigations to something small, while the overheads for Spectre
V1 and V2 mitigations haven't changed across processor generations and
are significant.  We speculate, however, that it should be possible to
reduce these overheads of these mitigations with hardware changes too;
for example, the Spectre V1 mitigation has a recognizable pattern of a
conditional move followed by a load instruction, which could be
detected by hardware to trigger special handling.
