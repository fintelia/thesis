Today's applications pay a performance penalty for mitigations to
protect against transient execution side-channel attacks such as
Meltdown~\cite{lipp:meltdown} and Spectre~\cite{kocher:spectre}.
This paper measures what those costs are across a range of CPUs from multiple vendors, and indentifies trends over successive generations of processors.
On workloads that stress the Linux kernel interface (which have received the most attention) there have been substantial improvements with slowdowns on LEBench going from over 30\% to less than 3\%.
By contrast, the overhead for JavaScript applications running inside
Firefox are impacted by an almost entirely different set of
mitigations.
On Octane 2, overhead has remained roughly flat at 20\%.
The overhead of software mitigations hasn't changed much,
but hardware changes that removed the need for a
few of the most expensive mitigations have significantly reduced overhead on some workloads.
